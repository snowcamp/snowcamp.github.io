      <description>{{ partial &#34;header.html&#34; . }}  {{ partial &#34;header_menu.html&#34; . }}    Snowcamp  The conference driving you (wal)nuts       What is SnowCamp? First and foremost, it&#39;s a high-level technical conference that focuses on innovation. SnowCamp brings IT professionals and researchers together to discuss today&#39;s and tomorrow’s technologies. SnowCamp is a unique concept: day-long workshops on Wednesday, to learn or improve a certain technology; a more classical conference on Thursday and Friday, with the bonus of allowing participants to discover research projects through 5 minutes pitches; a socializing and relaxing day on the snow, in the mountains, on Saturday.</description>
