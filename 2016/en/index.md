    SnowCamp only in Grenoble

#The [CFP](https://cfp.snowcamp.io) est open until the 25th of December. Time to write your proposals.

#### A local event
    Yes, SnowCamp is unique and in Grenoble, so it will drive you nuts

#### Snow 
    SnowCamp will be held on a Thursday and a Friday so we can go skiing/snowboarding/sledging on the Satur

#### Innovation
    To avoid being  just another conference (even with snow) SnowCamp is an opinionated conference
    With lightning talks from PhD students and researchers mix developpers with another branch of the geek society.
    Technical only
