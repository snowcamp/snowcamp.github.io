#### Snow 
-   SnowCamp will be held on a Thursday and a Friday so we can go skiing/snowboarding/sledging on the Saturday.

#### Innovation
-   To avoid being just another conference (even with snow) SnowCamp is an opinionated conference.
-   Technical only.
    With lightning talks from PhD students and researchers thus mixing developpers with another branch of the geek society.
-   Various talks vari√©s (Web, IoT, cloud, devops, Big Data), *lightning talks* from PhD students, researchers and *even from people who code*.
-   But it is also an *unconference* Saturday on the 23rd ofJanuary, we can can all meet on the snow slopes for fun.
