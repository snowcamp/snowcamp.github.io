    Get your skis ready for the 20th, 21st and 22nd of January 2016
    SnowCamp only in Grenoble!

#### A local event
-   Yes, SnowCamp is unique and in Grenoble, it will drive you [NUTS](http://www.grenoble-tourisme.com/en/discover/gastronomy/local-specialties-and-products/)!

#### Snow
-   SnowCamp will be held on a Thursday and a Friday so we can go skiing/snowboarding/sledging on the Saturday. But there will also be a university day on Wednesday for those who want to learn a new technology.

#### Innovation
-   To avoid being just another conference (even with snow) SnowCamp is an opinionated conference.
-   Technical only.
With lightning talks from PhD students and researchers thus mixing developers with another branch of the geek society.
-   Various talks (Web, IoT, Cloud, DevOps, Big Data), *lightning talks* from PhD students, researchers and *even from people who code*.
-   But it is also an *unconference* Saturday on the 23rd ofJanuary, we can can all meet on the snow slopes for fun.
